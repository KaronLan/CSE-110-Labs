        <p>The Minions are small, yellow, capsule shaped creatures, all-male, who have one or two eyes that were created by Eric Guillon (though there is a running joke, thanks to Karalynn Dunton, that it was Phineas and Ferb co-creator, Dan Povenmire).</p>

            <p id="p1"> As a rambunctious bunch of simple-minded homunculi, Minions are a similar size and shape but have unique features to tell them apart, such as height, number of eyes, roundness or secondary features such as hair, eye/pupil size or clothing.</p>
            <p id="p2"> Minions are yellow and wear black gloves, small black boots, metal goggles accommodating their number of eyes, and blue jean overalls with Gru's emblem on the fronts, they lack the emblem in Minions and Minions: The Rise of Gru due to them not officially being with Gru. Except for the mid-credits scene in MTROG.</p>
            <p id="p3">Minions possess few additional physiological characteristics; with a crack and a shake, they can double as glow sticks for activities in the dark, such as going through ventilation ducts. They additionally survive air, as one is seen without Despicable Me.</p>
            <p id="p4"> Twilight Sparkle is the central main character of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. She is a female unicorn pony who transforms into an Alicorn and becomes a princess in Magical Mystery Cure. She is also the daughter of Twilight Velvet and Night Light, the younger sister of Shining Armor, sister-in-law to Princess Cadance, and paternal aunt to Flurry Heart.

                At the beginning of the series, Twilight and Spike move from their residence in Canterlot to the Golden Oak Library in Ponyville to study the magic of friendship, and in Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2, she gains her own castle along with the title "Princess of Friendship". She represents the element of magic.
                
                Before becoming a princess, Twilight regularly sends friendship reports to Princess Celestia. In Owl's Well That Ends Well, she adopts a pet owl named Owlowiscious. As of The Last Problem, she is the ruler of Equestria.
                
                Twilight's human counterpart, Sci-Twi, briefly serves as an antagonist in My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games. </p>
