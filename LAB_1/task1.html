        <p>The Minions are small, yellow, capsule shaped creatures, all-male, who have one or two eyes that were created by Eric Guillon (though there is a running joke, thanks to Karalynn Dunton, that it was Phineas and Ferb co-creator, Dan Povenmire).</p>

            <p id="p1"> As a rambunctious bunch of simple-minded homunculi, Minions are a similar size and shape but have unique features to tell them apart, such as height, number of eyes, roundness or secondary features such as hair, eye/pupil size or clothing.</p>
            <p id="p2"> Minions are yellow and wear black gloves, small black boots, metal goggles accommodating their number of eyes, and blue jean overalls with Gru's emblem on the fronts, they lack the emblem in Minions and Minions: The Rise of Gru due to them not officially being with Gru. Except for the mid-credits scene in MTROG.</p>
            <p id="p3">Minions possess few additional physiological characteristics; with a crack and a shake, they can double as glow sticks for activities in the dark, such as going through ventilation ducts. They additionally survive air, as one is seen without Despicable Me.</p>
            <p id="p4"> Though there are several hundred minions, there are only about forty-eight possible combinations of height and build (short and chubby, medium, tall and thin), hair (tall buzz-cut, short buzz-cut, sprout, combed, bald), and eyes (one, two). </p>
